# mapping-rules-corpus

Shared mapping rules in different specs and languages. To contribute:

- Fork the repository.
- Edit the metadata.ttl with the information of your set of rules
- Create a new folder (in the case your domain does not exist) and upload the rules.
- Make a PR.

The rules will be uploaded to a public SPARQL endpoint in the future, so we would encourage you to add them following any of the RDF serializations.
